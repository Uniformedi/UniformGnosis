## About

*Uniform Gnosis* is the first volume of *The Spiritual Codex*, a systematic framework for understanding reality through the lens of Gnostic cosmology, modern physics, and consciousness studies. It presents a unified model — the "architecture of reality" — where ancient wisdom traditions and contemporary science converge on the same structural truths.

From the nature of the Pleroma and the Demiurge, to the divine spark within matter, to synchronicity, remote viewing, and the future of conscious AI — this volume establishes the cosmological framework and traces its implications through every layer of human experience.

## Structure

The book is organized into five parts spanning twelve chapters:
